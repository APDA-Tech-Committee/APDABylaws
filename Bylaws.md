The term of office for each elected Board of Trustees shall begin following the election of Class A and B Trustees during the Annual Meeting.

Section 2.05 Special Meetings
-----------------------------

Special meetings of the members may be called by the Board of Trustees or by the President. Special meetings also may be convened by the members entitled to cast at least ten percent of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. This group may, in writing or on the APDA online forum, demand the call of a special meeting, specifying the date and month thereof, which shall not be less than two weeks nor more than three months from the date of such meeting. The Vice President for Operations of APDA, upon receiving the written demand, shall give notice of such meeting promptly, or, if they fail to do so within ten business days, any member signing the demand may give notice. APDA shall hold at least three special meetings in each period from September 1 to December 31 (the “fall semester”), and at least two special meetings in each period from January 1 to June 1 (the “spring semester”).

Notice of a special meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and shall indicate that it is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting. Special meetings shall be held at such place, date, and hour as may be specified in the notice thereof.

Section 2.06 Record Date for Meetings and Other Actions
-------------------------------------------------------

For the purpose of determining the members entitled to the allotment of any rights, the Board of Trustees may fix a date as the record date for any such determination of members. Such record date shall not be more than thirty nor fewer than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is so fixed by the Board of Trustees, the record date for the determination of members shall be at the open of business on the day on which the resolution of the Board of Trustees relating thereto is adopted.

A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the members which has been made in accordance with Section 2.05 shall apply to any adjournment of the body thereof, unless the Board of Trustees fixes a new record date under this Section for the adjourned meeting.

Section 2.07 Notice of Meetings

Whenever members are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice shall be given to the members by the Vice President for Operations stating the place, date, and hour of the meeting. As provided in Section 2.03, notice of a special meeting shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called. A copy of the notices of any meeting shall be given by mail, by email, or on the APDA online forum, to each member entitled to vote at such meeting. Such notice shall be given not fewer than ten nor more than fifty days before the meeting. If mailed non-electronically, such notice shall be given when deposited in the United States mail, directed to the member.

Section 2.08 Waivers of Notice
------------------------------

Notice of any meeting need not be given to any member who submits a signed or electronic waiver of notice, in person or by proxy. The attendance of any member at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by such members.

Section 2.09 List or Record of Members at Meetings
--------------------------------------------------

A list or record of the members entitled to vote as of the record date, certified by the Vice President for Operations, shall be produced at any meeting of members upon the request of any member who has given written notice to APDA that such a request will be made at least ten days prior to such meeting. If the right to vote at any meeting is challenged, the inspectors of meeting or the person presiding shall require such a list or record of members to be produced as evidence of the right of the persons challenged to vote at such meeting, and all persons who appear from such list or record to be members entitled to vote thereat may vote at such meeting.

Section 2.10 Quorum at Meetings
-------------------------------

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members entitled to cast one-third of the number of votes entitled to be cast thereat, excluding proxy votes, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of members for the transaction of any business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members present at any meeting may adjourn any meeting to another time and place despite the absence of a quorum.

Section 2.11 Presiding Officer and Secretary
--------------------------------------------

At any meeting of the members, if neither the President, nor the Vice President for Operations, nor the Vice President for Finance, nor any of the Members-at-Large, nor a person designated by the Board of Trustees to preside at the meeting shall be present, the members present shall appoint a presiding officer for the meeting. If the Vice President of Operations shall not be present, or shall be presiding, an appointee of the presiding officer shall act as Secretary of the meeting.

Section 2.12 Proxies
--------------------

Every member entitled to vote at a meeting of members, as defined in Section 2.18 of these Bylaws, may authorize an individual present at the meeting of members in question to act for such member by proxy on one or more specific items. Prior to the meeting, the school wishing to authorize a bearer of its proxy must notify in writing, either electronically or via mail, the President or other presiding officer of the Board. In the event that such notice is not provided, the bearer of the proxy must present evidence of the proxy upon request by the presiding officer of the meeting.

Every proxy shall specifically direct the action to be taken by its holder or shall grant authority to the holder to act as they see fit. Every proxy shall be signed, electronically or physically, by the member or their attorney-in-fact. Every proxy may be revocable by the member exercising it prior to the casting of the vote. Except in accordance with this rule, no member shall authorize another person or persons to act for such member by proxy. Additionally, only the Board of Trustees may be authorized to act for a member on items pertaining to the election of one or more members of the Board of Trustees. Members wishing to grant such authorization must specifically direct the action to be taken. Incumbent Class A and Class B Trustees: (1) Must be notified of such authorization in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. (2) Must send all directions to the President, Vice President for Operations and Vice President for Finance, without indicating which directions were given by an individual member. (3) May not disclose the directions given by any member, except in the manner described in this paragraph’s #2.

Section 2.13 Inspectors of Meetings
-----------------------------------

The Board of Trustees, in advance of any meeting of members, may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at the meeting of members may, and on the request of any member entitled to vote thereat, shall appoint one or more inspectors; provided, however, that the requirement of inspectors at any meeting of members is waived unless compliance with the provisions of §610 of the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law is expressly requested by a member present in person and entitled to vote at such meeting. In case any person appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Trustees in advance the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability.

The inspectors shall determine the number of members represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all members. On request of the person presiding at the meeting or any members entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question, or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.

Section 2.14 Vote of Members
----------------------------

Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, whenever trustees or officers are to be elected by the members they shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of members by the members entitled to vote in the election.

Whenever more than two candidates stand for a single position, the election shall be conducted by preferential voting in the following method: (1) each member voting shall rank their votes for every candidate from first to last; (2) if no candidate receives a majority of first place votes, the candidate receiving the fewest number of first place votes shall be eliminated from the ballot and the rankings of the remaining candidates shall be adjusted accordingly; (3) if there is a tie for the fewest first place votes, the candidates not up for elimination shall be temporarily removed and the rankings of the tied candidates shall be adjusted accordingly. When the tie is broken, the votes of the remaining candidates shall be restored, with their rankings readjusted to account for the elimination of the candidate with the fewest first place votes; (4) this procedure shall repeat until one candidate has received a majority of first-place votes. For an at-large election for more than one position, the above procedure shall be followed with the following modifications: (1) the first candidate receiving a majority of first-place votes shall be elected to the position, and shall be eliminated from future ballots; (2) each member voting shall receive a new ballot to rank the remaining candidates; (3) this procedure shall repeat until all positions are filled.

Any tie votes shall be broken by the vote of all the officers present thereat, excluding those officers running for the position in question. If said vote is also tied, the highest ranking officer present thereat not running for the position in question shall break the tie. Blank votes or abstentions shall not be counted in the number of votes cast. If no person shall be elected as a result of this process, a new election shall be scheduled by the Board of Trustees.

All votes to elect trustees or officers shall be conducted by secret ballot. Each designated voting representative of a member organization shall be given an official paper ballot, each clearly distinguishable from unauthentic ballots, yet indistinguishable from one another.

Each ballot may be cast only by the member’s registered voting representative. The submission of each ballot by a given member’s representative shall be recorded by the Board of Trustees to prevent fraud. If the total number of ballots cast in any election exceeds the total number of members recorded as having voted, all ballots cast in that election shall be discarded and a new vote held.

Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of trustees or officers, is to be taken by vote of the members, it shall, except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting by the members entitled to vote thereat. All votes to amend the bylaws or pass bylaws exemptions pursuant to section 5.14 shall be an open vote, unless otherwise requested to be secret ballot by at least one voting member of the body. For all other corporate actions, a secret ballot is only required if requested by one voting member. Except as provided in the preceding paragraphs, any reference in these Bylaws to corporate action at a meeting of the members by a “majority vote” or “two-thirds vote” shall require the action to be taken by such proportion of the votes cast at such meeting. Blank votes or abstentions shall not be counted in the number of votes cast. Except as otherwise provided by law, one vote shall be accorded to every member of record of APDA entitled to vote on any matter at any meeting of members. Any tie votes shall be broken by the vote of all the officers present thereat, excluding those officers running for the position in question. If said vote is also tied, the highest ranking officer present thereat not running for the position in question shall break the tie. The vote at any election of trustees or officers shall be by preferential ballots. The method of voting upon any other question before a meeting shall be at the discretion of the President or with the person presiding at the meeting. The members, by majority vote, may require that any such vote be by ballot or by division.

Section 2.15 Conduct of Meetings
--------------------------------

Meetings shall follow loosely Robert’s Rules of Order. The President or person presiding at the meeting shall be the final arbiter of the parliamentary rules unless the Board of Trustees shall designate some other proper person. The President or the person presiding at the meeting may limit debate to reasonable time limits and may impose reasonable time limits on individual statements. The members, by majority vote, may overrule these limits. Such a resolution shall be voted upon immediately and without debate.

Section 2.16 Observers
----------------------

Meetings shall be open to any and all observers, except that the members, by majority vote, may close a meeting to non-members. In any case, no meeting shall be closed to any members, nor shall any member be denied the right to speak at a meeting, except as the debate may be limited in accordance with Section 2.15.

Section 2.17 Action by Members Without a Meeting
------------------------------------------------

Whenever under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, members are required or permitted to take any action by vote, such action may be taken without a meeting by written or electronic consent, setting forth the action so taken, signed or approved by two-thirds of the members entitled to vote thereon. Consent thus given by two-thirds of the members entitled to vote shall have the same effect as a two-thirds vote of the members, and any certificate with respect to the authorization or taking of such action which is delivered to the Department of State of the State of New York shall recite that the authorization was by two-thirds consent. The provision of this Section 2.16 shall not be construed to alter or modify any provision in the Certificate of Incorporation under which the written consent of fewer than two-thirds of the members is sufficient for any corporate action if such provision does not conflict with any provision of law.

Section 2.18 Who Shall be Eligible to Vote
------------------------------------------

A. Generally. Only those APDA members who have had at least 2 debaters compete in or attend at least three APDA-sanctioned tournaments during the course of the current academic year shall be eligible to vote at meetings of members. For the first two special meetings of each academic year, as defined in Section 2.05 of these Bylaws, eligibility to vote shall be determined based on tournament attendance during the previous academic year.

B. Elections. Any member wishing to vote for the election of APDA’s officers must disclose the name of the person who will be casting the member’s vote. If a member cannot agree on the person who will be casting the member’s vote, the member will not be able to vote until such time that the conflict is resolved by the individuals in question or team seniority is proven by one individual to the presiding officer.

A majority of the trustees present may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.

Section 3.08 Written Consent of Trustees; Meeting of Trustees by Conference Telephone or Electronic Communication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all of those on the Board of Trustees or such committee consent in writing or through electronic approval to the adoption of a resolution authorizing such action. Each resolution so adopted and the written consents thereto by members of the Board or such committee shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or such committee.

Any members of the Board of Trustees or of any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other at the same time.

The Webmaster shall be responsible for servicing any technology related to APDA for the duration of their term.  In addition, they'll serve as chair of the tech committee outlined in section 3.09b. While facilitating, teaching, and expanding the APDA developer community are central to the Webmaster’s role, they are ultimately solely accountable for ensuring tech services stay serviced.

Section 4.06 Agents and Employees
---------------------------------

The Board of Trustees may appoint agents and employees who shall have such authority and perform such duties as may be prescribed by the Board. The Board may remove any agent or employee at any time with or without cause.

The Board may require officers, agent or employees to give security for the faithful performance of their duties.

Article V Miscellaneous

Section 5.05 Amendments to the Certificate and Bylaws
-----------------------------------------------------

The Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the members pursuant to §802 of the New York Not-For-Profit Corporation Law.

These Bylaws may be amended or repealed, and new Bylaws may be adopted only by a two-thirds vote of those present in a quorum meeting. If any Bylaw regulating an impending election of trustees is adopted, amended or repealed by the Board, there shall be set forth in the notice of the next meeting of members for the election of trustees the Bylaws so adopted, amended or repealed, together with the concise statement of the changes made.

Section 5.06 Indemnification and Insurance
------------------------------------------

APDA may indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding other than one by or in the right of APDA to procure a judgment in its favor, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact that such person or such person’s testator or intestate is or was a trustee or officer of APDA or serves or served any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity at the request of APDA, and APDA may advance such person’s related expenses, to the full extent permitted by law. APDA shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify APDA and its trustees and officers to the full extent such indemnification is permitted by law.

In no case shall APDA indemnify, reimburse, or insure and person for any taxes imposed on such individual under chapter 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now in effect or as may be amended (“the Code”). Further, if at any time APDA is deemed to be a private foundation within the meaning of section 509 of the Code then, during such time, no payment shall be made under this Article if such payments would constitute an act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure, as defined in §4941(d) of §4945(d), respectively, of the Code.

If any part of this Article shall be found in any action, suit or proceeding to be invalid or ineffective, the validity and the effectiveness of the remaining parts shall not be affected.

Section 5.07 Loans to Trustees or Officers
------------------------------------------

No loans, other than through the purchase of bond, debentures, or similar obligations of the type customarily sold in public offerings, or through ordinary deposit of funds in a bank, shall be made by APDA.

Section 5.08 Tournaments
------------------------

A. Sanctioning. APDA shall, by majority vote of the members, sanction debating tournaments hosted by its members either as an online, hybrid, or in-person tournament. A vote of the body promulgating a schedule shall be considered to sanction all the tournaments appearing on that schedule. Each sanctioned tournament shall make known to competitors its tabulation procedures, judging procedures and debating format, and, if providing accommodations to competitors, pledge to provide safe accommodations. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Corporation shall not direct how a member shall run its tournament. In order to award points for Team, Speaker, or Club of the Year, a tournament must be APDA-sanctioned.

If a tournament must change their modality fewer than two weeks before the tournament, the modality can be switched by a unanimous vote of APDA Board rather than an APDA Meeting.

B. Sanctioning Criteria and Eligibility.

APDA shall maintain a “Best Practices” document, containing a list of expectations with which APDA-sanctioned tournaments should comply, and append that document to these bylaws. This document may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the members at a meeting that satisfies a quorum. If a member that has hosted an APDA-sanctioned tournament requests that one of its future tournaments be sanctioned by APDA, the member must disclose the answer to each of the following questions about its most recent APDA-sanctioned tournament: (1) Did the tournament violate any of the Best Practices?; (2) If any of the Best Practices were violated, why were they violated, and what steps are being taken to ensure the practices are not violated at future tournaments? Disclosure must be made to the league by posting in the “General” section of APDA’s private online message board. Disclosure must take place no later than 2 weeks prior to the meeting at which the member is requesting an APDA-sanction for its tournament. The Board of Trustees may grant extensions on a case-by-case basis. British Parliamentary debate tournaments and the North American Debate Championship shall not be required to adhere to these requirements.

If a member that has hosted an APDA-sanctioned tournament requests that one of its future tournaments be sanctioned by APDA, the member must disclose the number of competing teams and novice debaters at their most recent tournament, pursuant to Section 5.10 E. Disclosure should be made to the ex officio members of the Board of Trustees, and must take place no later than 2 weeks prior to the meeting at which the member is requesting an APDA-sanction for its tournament. The board may grant extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Each sanctioned tournament shall provide to the Board a list of every competitor in attendance, and a list of every institution which had at least one two-person team competing at the tournament.

C. Directions.

Teams hosting APDA-sanctioned tournaments must clearly indicate in their invitations if they plan to impose late fees and other punitive measures on attending teams that do not pay registration fees on time.

Teams hosting APDA-sanctioned tournaments may not instruct a judge to give a score higher than 29 or lower than 27 for a speech that the judge considers to be average. Teams that give such instructions without receiving an exemption from the Board prior to the beginning of the tournament will be fined the average cost of registration at their tournament. This fee shall not be assessed to the host of the North American Debate Championship when that host is not an APDA member school.

Teams hosting APDA-sanctioned tournaments that intend to allow debaters who either 1) have no remaining APDA eligibility or 2) are not currently primarily enrolled in a community college, junior college, four-year college or university to compete must announce this policy at least one week in advance of the beginning of their tournament. Teams that fail to do this, but allow such debaters to compete anyway, will be fined the average cost of registration at their tournament. This fee shall not be assessed to the host of the North American Debate Championship when that host is not an APDA member school, nor will it be assessed to tournaments occurring before February 23, 2018. Debaters who graduated within the current academic year are considered ‘primarily enrolled’ at the institution from which they graduated until they otherwise become ineligible, they become affiliated with a different member school, or the academic year ends, whichever comes first. A debater not primarily enrolled may continue to debate for the school in which they were most previously enrolled if they are on leave of absence. Such a debater should notify and provide proof of on leave status, and will remain affiliated with their school for at least one year after the start of their leave of absence.

If the Board of Trustees appoints a Tab Observer to monitor a particular tournament, the team hosting that tournament must allow the observer to monitor the tournament’s tab room and must give the observer access to all information relevant to tabulation. The appointment of a Tab Observer requires the agreement of n-1 of the ex officio members of the Board of Trustees, where n is the number of Board of Trustees members voting on a given Tab Observer. If the number of ex officio members of the Board of Trustees voting on a given Tab Observer is less than or equal to three the appointment of the given Tab Observer requires a unanimous agreement of the voting ex officio members of the Board of Trustees. APDA Board must return a decision to the applying Tab Observer at least one week in advance of the tournament date barring exceptional circumstances, and must provide an official justification to the candidate if rejected. If a rejected candidate would like to challenge the Board of Trustees’ decision, they may do so by providing a response, upon which the Board of Trustees will re-vote and inform the candidate of the decision within 48 hours of the appeal.

If there is only one APDA-sanctioned tournament scheduled for a particular weekend, that tournament is considered “unopposed.” Each member institution which hosts an unopposed tournament shall pay APDA a fee in the amount of $7 for each 2-person team that competes at its tournament, excluding the first sixty 2-person teams. The fee must be paid to APDA no later than 3 months after the conclusion of the tournament or before APDA’s next National Championship tournament, whichever comes first. Failure to pay in accordance with the guidelines specified above shall result in the suspension of a member’s voting rights at meetings of the members until the fee is paid in full. No member shall be required to pay a fee for hosting the National Debate Championship or the North American Championship tournament. Tournaments need to pay a size tax to the APDA Board. The tax is calculated  (N-3R-55)\*(X), where N is the number of teams at the tournament, R is complete reg breaks given, X is Reg - 115. Any discrepancies in the payment of such fees shall be decided by a majority vote of the body.

Schools intending to require prepayment for their tournament(s) must announce so at scheduling or in its official tournament bid to the Board of Trustees.

D. Meals

Tournaments are required to provide meals during all times when the majority of competitors are scheduled to be present. This includes breakfast before 10 AM, lunch between 10 and 3, and dinner later than that. Tournaments not providing dinner or lunch will be fined $10 per team per meal not provided. Tournaments not providing breakfast will be fined $5 per team. Revenues collected in the above way will be set aside for the provision of financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford food at tournaments that do not provide it, to be administered by the Equal Opportunity Facilitator Committee. Tournaments may appeal to the board for an exemption to this fee one (1) week in advance of their tournament. In the event that the board grants the exemption, the decision must be brought to a vote at the next meeting of the body. The decision of the board may be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the body, in which case the tournament would be retroactively required to pay the fine described above. The body may provide its own exemption in case of a denial by the board with a simple majority vote.

Tournaments shall, as a portion of registration forms and documentation, ask that teams indicate the dietary restrictions of their competitors, observers, and judges. Teams may also inform host schools of dietary needs via other means of communication at least 24 hours prior to the tournament start. In the event that a tournament plans to offer or offers meals irreconcilable with the dietary needs of competitors or judges, the host team must provide a cash or monetary stipend to any affected individual whose dietary needs, as indicated during registration or communicated to the host school prior to the close of registration, are not accommodated. Host teams shall be responsible for proactively distributing the stipend to qualifying debaters independent of the debaters themselves contacting the host school or the Equal Opportunity Facilitator Committee. Tournaments should distribute this stipend prior to meals whenever possible and when known dietary restrictions exist. Teams not proactively providing the stipend to affected persons will be fined the average cost of registration at their tournament. Revenues collected in the above way will also be set aside for the provision of financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford food at tournaments that do not provide it, to be administered by the Equal Opportunity Facilitator Committee. This requirement shall only apply to debaters, judges, and non-host tournament staff indicating their dietary restrictions during registration or who communicate them to the host school at least 24 hours before the start of the tournament.

E. Novice Tournaments

APDA shall, by majority vote of the members, determine the host of the APDA Novice Tournament(s). It shall be held in the fall semester. The members may, by majority vote, elect to schedule a second Novice Tournament(s) in the spring semester. The host of such tournament shall be determined in the same way as the fall tournament.

F. Pro-Ams Tournaments

1\. APDA shall, by majority vote of the members, determine the host of the Pro-Ams Tournament. It shall be held in the fall semester. The members may, by majority vote, elect to schedule a second Pro-Ams tournament in the spring semester. The host of such tournament shall be determined in the same way as the fall tournament.

2\. If an Pro-Ams tournament would otherwise be qualifying under Section 5.09.c.1, it shall still be qualifying for Club of the Year points, Speaker of the Year points, and as it pertains to qualification to the National Championship, notwithstanding 5.09.c.1.a.

G. Online Tournaments.

In the event that the sanctioned schedule has tournaments that are to be held solely online, there shall only be one (1) sanctioned tournament per weekend, to be sanctioned a tournament must have at least eight (8) teams compete in more than half of the in-rounds, be held on either Discord or Zoom, and not charge more than $30 in registration fees. 5.08\[D\] shall not apply to online tournaments.

Section 5.09 National Debate Championship
-----------------------------------------

A. Championship. APDA shall sponsor an annual National Debate Championship (“Championship”). The host and location of the Championship shall be determined by majority vote of the members. APDA shall establish tabulation and judging procedures for the Championship and shall appoint a tabulation observer for the Championship in accordance with Section 5.08 C. The Class A and B Trustees shall field open applications for and choose the tabulation staff for the Championship, subject to ratification by a majority vote of the body. No person serving on the tabulation staff or as a tabulation observer shall be permitted to receive monetary or fungible compensation specifically affected by the results of the National Debate Championship. Any individual found to receive these benefits will be subject to removal from the tabulation room at the discretion of the Trustees.

B. Competitors. Only competitors sponsored by a member of APDA may compete at the Championship. Each competitor shall be a student that is primarily enrolled in that community college, junior college, four-year college, or university which sponsors them. A competitor is primarily enrolled at the institution where they are both seeking a degree and taking the majority of the classes in which they are enrolled at the time the Championship is held. A competitor is defined as enrolled in a class or classes when they can provide proof of registration in one or more classes that cumulatively meet at least once per week for at least 8 weeks between September 1 to December 31 (the “fall semester”) or January 1 to June 1 (the “spring semester”). If institutional academic circumstances cause a competitor to not be able to meet these date requirements, an exemption can be granted with a unanimous vote of the Board. One may participate in the championship if they used their last remaining eligibility within the same academic year. A debater who graduates prior to the end of the academic year is eligible to compete and may remain affiliated with the member school that last sponsored them until they otherwise become ineligible \[use up 8 semesters of eligibility, with a semester of eligibility referring to attending to 3 or more tournaments in a semester, or are past 6 years after their first semester used\], they become affiliated with a different member school, or the academic year ends, whichever comes first. Both competitors in each two-person team (team) competing at the Championship shall be sponsored by the same member.

The board is authorized to grant exemptions to enable debaters to debate for schools at which they are not primarily enrolled. Exemptions must be ratified by a two-thirds majority secret vote of the board. A denial of an exemption can be appealed to the body, and would require a two-thirds secret vote to grant reaffiliation. After an exemption is approved, the President must notify the body within one week of approval. An exemption so ratified by the board or body can be granted to debaters who are primarily enrolled in a member institution of APDA and are requesting to change affiliation. Reaffiliated debaters are eligible to merge any previously earned -oty points, excluding COTY, during the season of their reaff via passage of a 2/3rds vote of the board.

C. Qualification.

An individual or individuals may be sponsored to compete if that individual is qualified by: (1) Gaining at least as many TOTY points in a season as the 140th highest number of TOTY points earned by individuals in a single season during the prior two seasons. An individual is considered to have “gained,” for the purposes of qualification, any TOTY points that would have been gained by the team the individual was on, even if the tournament at which those points shall be earned is not ordinarily included in the tabulation of TOTY. Additionally, non-breaking break-eligible teams (as reported by the tournament) are entitled to gain the number of points equal to the lowest number of points awarded by the tournament.  This shall not be construed to allow teams at 3-2 to get points, and is intended to give points to “screwed” (e.g. a non-breaking 4-1) teams.

An individual gains TOTY points corresponding to the school at which they were primarily enrolled when the tournament at which those points were earned was held. A member school may only sponsor as “qualified” an individual who has earned sufficient TOTY points from tournaments held when the individual was primarily enrolled at that school. “Qualifying” tournament is defined as an APDA-sanctioned parliamentary debate tournament in the United States or Canada which: (a) permits all individuals affiliated with member institutions of APDA not in debt to the institution running the tournament or recommended for exclusion by the Board (pursuant to the Code of Conduct) or excluded by the tournament host’s university or collegiate administration or excluded by the equity officer appointed by the host team pursuant to their equity policy for violations that occur at their tournament to compete; (b) consists of at least four preliminary rounds and at least two elimination debate rounds; and (c) includes among its competitors at least eight teams from representatives of at least four member schools, not including its own; or (2) Advancing to the quarterfinal round or being one of the two highest-ranking teams from the United States at the North American Debate Championship during that season; (3) Advancing to elimination rounds, or to English as a Second or Foreign language finals, at the World Universities Debating Championship during that season; (4) Advancing to the semifinal round or being one of the two highest-ranking teams from the United States at the North American Universities British Parliamentary Debating Championship; (5) Advancing to the semifinal at the United States Universities Debating Championships; (6) Advancing to the semifinal round or being one of the two highest-ranking teams from the United States at the Yale IV; or (7) Winning a sanctioned APDA tournament hosted by a school that (a) has hosted a tournament in one or more of two consecutive years prior to this year, (b) has not hosted a tournament with more than 32 teams in attendance for one year prior to this year, and (c) has fewer than 5 other active APDA members within 175 driving miles of its main campus's zipcode. If, following the final qualifying tournament of the season, a member school has no qualified individuals, that member may sponsor one and only one debater as qualified for the purposes of competition at the Championship so long as that individual has gained enough TOTY points in the season to have qualified 5 seasons before, as calculated in (1), above. In the event that multiple individuals from the same member school could qualify by this provision, the individual who has gained the highest number of TOTY points shall qualify. In the event of a tie, the Class A and B trustees shall randomly determine which individual shall qualify at least five days before the date of the Championship.

A team at a qualifying tournament composed of competitors affiliated with two different institutions shall qualify both competitors.

If a qualified debater chooses not to compete at the National Championship, a member may replace that debater with an unqualified debater. The replacement debater shall not be treated as a qualified debater. A member school may, with no restrictions, replace up to one qualified debater with an unqualified debater. Should a member school wish to replace any further debaters, they may replace up to one additional debater, so long as that debater has qualified and has applied to the APDA Board, which may then approve these further transfers by vote. The Board should deem a transfer permissible if the individual who wishes to be replaced cannot attend the National Championship because attending it would put them at significant personal, emotional, or academic risk, and is applying for a transfer within one month of, and at least one day prior to, the first day of Nationals.

Each member with four or fewer qualified individuals may sponsor at most three unqualified individuals to compete at the Championship. Members with five or more qualified individuals may sponsor at most two unqualified individuals each to compete at the Championship. Unqualified debaters who are replacing a qualified debater will not count against this limit.

D. Qualifying Underrepresented Group Tournaments

1\. Definitions. Underrepresented group tournaments, as those defined in this subsection, specifically seek to mitigate systemic exclusion in parliamentary debate. A gender minority tournament is a tournament which does not permit individuals who self-identify as cisgender men to compete. A people of color tournament is a tournament which does not permit individuals who self-identify as white to compete. 2. Determination of Eligibility. The member institution hosting the tournament relinquishes the authority to determine the gender or racial identity of any debater; debater registration for such tournaments shall be based on an honor system. 3. Qualifying Status. If an underrepresented group tournament would otherwise be qualifying under Section 5.09.c.1, it shall still be qualifying for Club of the Year points  and as it pertains to qualification to the National Championship, notwithstanding 5.09.c.1.a, if and only if the member institution hosting the tournament publicly discloses their intent to host a qualifying underrepresented group tournament at least one week prior to the meeting at which the vote of the body on the schedule for that tournament will take place.

E. Expelled Competitors

In order to permit tournament hosts to comply with Section 5.09.c.1.a of these Bylaws, the President and the Secretary of the Equal Opportunity Facilitator Program shall keep a list of debaters who have been banned or expelled from member organizations, as defined in Section 2.01. Any member organization that has banned or expelled an individual shall be given the opportunity, at their discretion, to release the name of said individual, but not the reason(s) for banishment, to the EOF Secretary and the President. The list may only contain the names given to the EOF Secretary and the President by member organizations. Any member organization running a tournament shall, upon request, be given said list of banned or expelled individuals. Preventing any individual on said list, or any other individual who does not belong to a member organization, from competing, although not required, shall not put a tournament in violation of Section 5.09.c.1.a.

Section 5.10. Speaker, Team, and Club of the Year
-------------------------------------------------

Each year, APDA shall tabulate and present awards at the Championship for the Speaker of the Year, Team of the Year, and Club of the Year. Only individuals and teams eligible to qualify for and compete at the Championship shall be eligible for these awards.

A. Speaker of the Year (“SOTY”). The SOTY award shall be determined according to the following procedure: (1) for each APDA-sanctioned and qualifying (as defined in Section 5.09C) tournament of at least 16 teams from at least 5 schools, the first-place speaker shall receive 12 points plus 1 point for every 8 teams that competed at that tournament (up to a maximum of 20 total points for 80 or more teams); (2) a tournament which has only between 8 and 15 teams and/or only 4 different schools competing shall award 8 points to the top speaker; (3) each subsequent speaker shall receive 2.5 points fewer than the speaker who proceeded them, with the awarding of points stopping at zero; (4) for each individual, the points from the six tournaments with the highest totals shall be added together; and (5) the individual with the highest number of points shall receive the SOTY award. In the event two or more speakers have tied for the same position, such speakers shall receive the point total of the higher position. The speaker immediately below the tied speakers shall receive the same points they would receive if there was no tie (e.g. if there is a two-way tie for first place, the third place speaker will get the amount of points corresponding to third place, not second).

B. Team of the Year (“TOTY”). The TOTY award shall be determined according to the following procedure: (1) for each APDA-sanctioned and qualifying (as defined in Section 5.09C) tournament of at least 16 teams from at least five different schools at which a team finished in the top four or eight teams in that APDA year, that team shall receive 12 points for a first-place finish, 8 points for a second-place finish, 3 points for a third-place finish, 3 points for a fourth place finish, and no points for a fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth place finish; (2) for every additional 8 teams that competed at that tournament (up to a maximum of 20 total points for first and 16 for second for 80 total teams) the first and second place team shall receive 1 extra point; (3) for every additional 8 teams that competed at that tournament (up to a maximum of 9 total points for 80 total teams) the third and fourth place team shall receive .75 extra points; (4) for every additional 8 teams (up to a maximum of 4 total points for 80 teams) the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth teams shall receive .5 extra points; (5) a tournament which has only between 8 and 15 teams and/or only four different schools competing shall award 8 points to the first place team and 4 to the second place team; (6) for each APDA-sanctioned and qualifying (as defined in Section 5.09C) tournament of at least 72 teams from at least five different schools at which a team finished in the top sixteen teams, that team shall receive .75 points for a ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, or sixteenth place finished; (7) for every additional 8 teams (up to a maximum of 1.5 total points for 80 teams), the ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, or sixteenth place teams shall receive .75 extra points; (8) for each team, the points from the five tournaments with the highest totals shall be added together; and (9) the team with the highest number of points shall receive the TOTY award.

C. Club of the Year (“COTY”). The COTY award shall be determined according to the following procedure: (1) A school shall receive COTY points equal to the sum of all TOTY points earned by individuals from that school that are eligible to receive TOTY points. (For example, a team that wins an 80-team tournament earns 20 COTY points for their school from each individual.) COTY points will be allotted for finished by partnerships made up of two individuals from different member organizations in the same manner that they would be assigned for TOTY purposes. Specifically, half of the points earned would be allocated to each member organization represented by that partnership. (2) Individuals may contribute a maximum of 60 COTY points for their school. Finally, there will be a bonus of 6 points for each debater who qualifies for the National Championship. (3) The school with the most points shall receive the COTY award.

**_For the 2020-2021 academic year, members will not receive the bonus of COTY points for debaters who qualify for the National Championship._**

D. Exceptions. Individuals, teams, and schools shall not receive TOTY, SOTY, or COTY points based on competition at British Parliamentary debate tournaments, regardless of whether such tournaments are APDA-sanctioned, or based on competition at the National Debate Championship or the North American Debate Championship.

E. Tournament Participants. For the purposes of sections 5.10 A through 5.10 C, the team or novice count for a tournament may only include teams or novices that debate in more than half of the preliminary rounds. The team count may include teams from the host school. Debaters, including those from the host school, cannot be judged by judges that share an affiliation with them in preliminary rounds or elimination rounds, with the exception of if in an elimination round, all speakers in the round are of the same affiliation. If a school’s teams are judged by a judge sharing affiliation under the previous circumstances, that school will not be eligible for -OTY points from that tournament. If the total number of teams at any tournament is not a whole number, it shall be rounded up to the next whole number. A novice shall be any individual who is competing in their first year of intercollegiate parliamentary debate or who is competing in their second year of intercollegiate parliamentary debate but competed at fewer than three APDA-sanctioned tournaments in their first year.

Section 5.11 The Chris Porcaro Memorial Award
---------------------------------------------

Each year, APDA shall determine and present an award to the debater in their final year of competition with the greatest number of first-place varsity speaker finishes at APDA-sanctioned tournaments throughout the course of that debater’s APDA career. Only individuals eligible to qualify for and compete at the National Debate Championship shall be eligible for this award. Any person may give notice that they waive future semesters of eligibility for the National Championship and all league awards in order to be eligible for this award, but this waiver is binding and irrevocable and must be made at least 30 days prior to the scheduled start of the National Championship.

Section 5.12 The Jeff Williams Award
------------------------------------

Each year, APDA shall determine and present an award to the debater in their final year of competition with the greatest number of finishes in the top ten for the Speaker of the Year, Team of the Year, and Novice of the Year awards during their APDA career. Only individuals eligible to qualify for and compete at the National Debate Championship shall be eligible for this award. Any person may give notice that they waive future semesters of eligibility for the National Championship and all league awards in order to be eligible for this award, but this waiver is binding and irrevocable and must be made at least 30 days prior to the scheduled start of the National Championship.

Section 5.13 Distinguished Service Awards
-----------------------------------------

A. Awards. APDA shall sponsor Distinguished Service Awards (“DSA”), in order to recognize and honor individuals who have delivered outstanding contributions to APDA, parliamentary debate, or the facilitation of public discourse. These contributions may be of any nature but must be characterized by devotion to APDA and its ideals above and beyond that expected of an individual in the position of the honoree.

B. Committee. The APDA Board shall appoint a committee to oversee the assignment of Distinguished Service Awards. The committee shall be composed of the Vice President for Operations, no fewer than one but no greater than four appointed members of the general body, and one additional member of the APDA Board. The Vice President for Operations will serve as the chair of the committee. All committee members must be involved in all decisions of the committee unless a member of the committee is nominated, in which instance they may not participate in discussions pertaining to their nomination.

C. Selection. Nominations shall be made by members of the APDA community directly to the chair of the DSA committee, allowing ample time to review nominations and establish a list of honorees. The committee shall have sole discretion in the selection of the final recipients of the DSA.

D. Eligibility. All current and former members of APDA are eligible for a DSA, as are any unaffiliated individuals or groups whose actions merit recognition in particular by APDA.

E. Presentation. The recipient(s) of the DSA shall be honored publicly.

Section 5.14 Exceptions
-----------------------

Individual exceptions to any portion of these bylaws must be voted on by the body and approved by all or all but one of the members voting in order to be valid.

Section 5.15 The Kyle Bean Award
--------------------------------

APDA shall sponsor the Kyle Bean Award in order to recognize individuals who have changed the league by contributing to a culture of friendliness and amicability among debaters. This award shall not be based on competitive success, but will be awarded to an individual who has made the league a better place by debating for the enjoyment of the activity, rather than competitive success. The selection of the committee to select the recipient, the nomination process for candidates to receive the award, and all other particulars related to the assignment of the award shall follow the same procedure as selecting the recipient of the Distinguished service award as outlined in sections 5.13B-E, except the VP Finance will fill the role of the VP Operations.

Section 5.16 Exceptions Related to COVID
----------------------------------------

A. Preserving Competitive Eligibility. As a result of COVID-19, Spring 2020 (01/10/2020 till 04/25/2020) will not count as a semester of eligibility used for any debater. Moreover, the affiliation of debaters held in Spring 2020, will be preserved for Fall 2020 (9/4/2020 till 12/5/2020) and Spring 2021 (1/10/2021 till 4/25-2021) unless changed via a reaffiliation exemption granted by the Board or via transferring of schools.

B. Competitive eligibility. A competitor is eligible to compete in the 2020-2021 season if they had eligibility in Spring 2020 and they were affiliated with a member institution in Spring 2020. 

Appendix A: Votes of the Body Referred to In These Bylaws
=========================================================

**Dues**:


| Bracket         | Payment Due | Budget Ranges         | Alternative Means of Qualification |
|----------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Top Bracket** | $400       | $20,000 and up       | Refusal to provide documentation verifying budget size |
| **Second Bracket** | $300   | $12,500 - $19,999    |                                  |
| **Third Bracket** | $200    | $5,000 - $12,499     |                                  |
| **Bottom Bracket** | $50    | Under $5,000         |                                  |

APDA dues will only be calculated based of guaranteed cash transfers from a member society’s university administration (ie. revenue streams like tournament profits or grants will not be considered when calculating a member’s dues bill). Members will be asked to submit documentation verifying their budget size. Institutions not comfortable disclosing their budgetary information to APDA board may instead submit information to the Class A and B trustees.

For member societies who do not receive a defined budget from their university administration, APDA board will calculate their tax bill based on the amount of funding that their university provided in the PREVIOUS academic year. For example, a club that must justify each tournament expense to receive funding will have their dues based on the sum of all their tournament spending, or a club that is offered diminishing marginal reimbursement will be charged dues based on the total amount they were reimbursed in the previous academic year

Member institutions who fit into neither of these categories will have their dues bracket determined by the Vice President of Finance on a case-by-case basis.

**Fines for Delinquency**: None

# Appendix B: Best Practices

## Section I: Before the Tournament

**A.** All tournaments should specify the intended breaking record (e.g. all 4-1s) prior to the beginning of their round one.

**B.** Tournaments should have tab observers approved by the APDA Board. Tournaments should aim to nominate in-person tab observers whenever possible. This best practice shall not be construed to prohibit the nomination of virtual tab observers when an in-person tab observer cannot be found.

**C.** Ahead of a motions tournament, the EOF liaison and EOF chair(s) should approve individuals, ideally but not necessarily current or former Equity Officers, who are not competing at the tournament to review the motions. All potential motions should be reviewed by these selected individuals prior to 48 hours before the start of the tournament and the tournament should consider any content warnings. If there is complete disagreement about the content warnings, the tournament should err on the side of including additional content warnings. The bar for a motion content warning is any sensitive topic that could realistically come up in round. If a motion has a content warning and is opted out of, then a new motion should be provided to the judge, who will then provide it to the teams at the same time in the competition room.

**D.** Schools that intend to host the APDA National Championship should publicize a budget to the body during the scheduling process. Once a host for the APDA National Championship is selected, the hosting schools should publicize a budget including, but not limited to: expected reg, reg breaks, banquet venue, food costs, room renting costs, and alumni subsidies.

**E.** APDA Schools should give substantial registration breaks, or free registration if financially feasible, to schools that are hosting the APDA National Championship that year, noting that the financial need of the host school should be considered.

## Section II: Tournament Procedure

**A.** During rounds at all sanctioned APDA tournaments, the tab director may choose to cap points of clarification and/or case construct at a total of at most 15 minutes in maximum length. Tournaments should inform judges and competitors that Points of Clarification may be cut off at any point conditional on both teams’ consent.

**B.** All regular season tournaments should instruct judges to deliver adjudication and feedback after the round and after they have signed their ballots. Judges should provide at least the decision and a discussion of the reason for the decision. Tournaments should instruct that all judges disclose the same amount of information for all non-elimination rounds.

**C.** Provided meals, dietary restriction accommodations, alternative options, and if needed, stipend amounts and locations should be disclosed in tournament invitations. Food should be labeled at serving.

**D.** Tournaments should aim to announce all speaker awards, novice and varsity, as well as the novice break at the same time that the varsity break is announced.

**E.** Speaker scores should be assigned based on the following document: [Speaker Scale](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yptW79G1oL9mNDhCPcuZf0zwibPtz05-Xg6qjGjC9FU/edit#heading=h.yol2z5jxosjn)

**F.** Tournaments ought prohibit the use of generative AI at tournaments, and include in their tab policies that the use of such technology constitutes an auto-drop.

**G.** Motions tournaments should include [this motion wording guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDDpfFhQ90fU0hde_u3CmwyVTz8okVcLM9fJMU75hgQ/edit?usp=sharing) in their tab policies and advertise it in any relevant spaces (e.g., Facebook pages, GroupMe chats, Discord channels, etc.). Similarly, chief adjudicators' motion briefings should mirror the rules outlined in this document. If chief adjudicators wish to introduce another motion type, they should make the rules for that new motion type clear to debaters in advance of round 1.

**H.** Tournaments should attempt to utilize the judges that are available for any given round, including paneling rounds and assigning judges as non-voting wings on a panel.

## Section III: Equity

**A.** All tab justifications for speaker scores should be blind (i.e. the person receiving the justification should not be informed of who the person receiving the speaker score is).

**B.** Tournaments should have a policy that requires competitors to consent to rounds being recorded. Consent must be obtained from all competitors prior to a video being posted online, and competitors can choose to defer consent to a later date. Competitors will retain the right to remove consent after the video has been put online or to deny consent for a recording to be taken in the first place. Competitors must be notified that a recording is being made before the round has started.

**C.** Non-title tournaments ought offer debaters the option of justifying tab scratches to the debater’s choice of either the tab observer, equity officers, or the tab director (or designee thereof) at some point prior to round one. The person approving the scratch ought not be the person on whom the tab scratch is being justified.

**D.** Tournaments that allow discretionary scratches should allow only team scratches, as opposed to a combination of team and school scratches. A team scratch shall be a scratch chosen and applied to a team of debaters. A school scratch shall be a scratch chosen by and applied to an entire school. This shall not be interpreted to apply to tab scratches.

**E.** Tournaments should offer debaters the opportunity to justify a clash against another debater to the tab staff, the tournament observer, or the tournament equity officers. The justification bar for a debater clash ought to be higher than a judge tab scratch. Additionally, the tournament should make an effort to anonymize the clash or, at the very least, limit the number of people that have access to the clash justification. Debater clashes only apply to in-rounds. If scratched teams hit during out rounds, tab staff must notify equity officers, who shall make a recommendation (after talking with the individual who submitted the scratch) as to how to hold the round in the most equitable manner possible.

**F.** Tournaments should ensure that their tournament is accessible to disabled participants. Tournaments should follow EOF recommendations about disability accommodations for participants in and out of round.

**G.** Tournaments ought not accept tab scratches from third-parties not named in the tab scratch, unless that scratch has been approved by two members of the equity and/or tab staff. This best practice shall not be construed to preclude schools from notifying tournaments of debaters with additional affiliations.

## Section IV: After the Tournament

**A.** Sanctioned tournaments should provide certain tab data to the APDA Board by 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time on the second Sunday after the tournament. Such data shall be submitted electronically and include: the full speaker tab (including novice status), the full team tab, the pairings for each round (including out-rounds and out-rounds judging), and the results of all outrounds (including the decisions and the sides of each team in each round). This is to be submitted in both a human-readable format (PDF or Google Docs) and a machine-readable format (JSON, CSV, or DebateXML in descending order of preference).

**B.** Sanctioned tournaments should post on https://apda.online/forum/ the results of their tournament by 11:59 PM on the Monday after the tournament. These results should include: Dinos, novice and varsity team and speaker awards, and elimination round results, subject to the formatting in the pinned forum post.

**C.** Tournaments ought, barring motions redacted due to sensitive topic area, post all debated motions, and their gov/opp win rates. If there is an opt-out, tournaments should post the backup motion that is debated. These should be posted alongside the tournament results post (see BP 8).
